Hello, intrepid Github reader!

The "flavor text" words for things in this mod and the internal names are different. (Sorry.)

- A "Hex" is a `Spell`, cast through a [`CastingHarness`](casting/CastingHarness.kt)
- A "Pattern" is a [`HexPattern`](hexmath/HexPattern.kt)
- An "Action" is a [`SpellOperator`](casting/SpellOperator.kt)
