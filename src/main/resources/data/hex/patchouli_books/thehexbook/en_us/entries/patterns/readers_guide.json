However, a strange force guides my hand calling itself the \"mod developer,\" raving the strangest things about how she \"wants to get the mod out already\" and \"is sick of typing JSON\" and \"wonders how many levels of fourth-wall breaking we're on.\"$(br2)It's probably a delusion from staring at hexagons too often, but I do wonder."

(The number needs to be on the top of the stack, with the vector write below it.) \"\u2192 $(n)entity/$\", means it takes no iotas and pushes an entity. \"$(n)entity, vector/$ \u2192\" means it pops an entity and a vector, and doesn't push anything."
